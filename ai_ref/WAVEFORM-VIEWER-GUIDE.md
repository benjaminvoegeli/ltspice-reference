## Trace Selection

### Probing from Schematic

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click wire | Plot node voltage |
| Click component body (2-terminal) | Plot current through component |
| Click component pin | Plot current into that pin |
| Double-click same trace | Isolate it (erase other traces) |
| Alt+Click component body | Plot instantaneous power (Watts) |
| Alt+Click wire | Plot wire current |
| Click node, drag to another | Differential voltage V(a,b) |

Mouse cursor icons indicate measurement type (voltage probe, current clamp, thermometer for power).

### From Menu

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| E | 2.71828... |
| pi | 3.14159... |
| K | 1.3806503e-23 (Boltzmann) |
| Q | 1.602176462e-19 (electron charge) |

### Keywords

- `time` — horizontal axis for transient analysis
- `omega` or `w` — angular frequency for AC analysis

### Dimensional Analysis

The viewer performs dimensional analysis on expressions and labels results with calculated units (V, A, W, Ohm, etc.). Traces with the same units share a vertical axis.

Example: `-2*pi*pow(V(out),2)/abs(V(n001))/Ie(x1:Q1)` → identified as Ohm

### Average and RMS

Zoom to a region of interest, then **Ctrl+Left-click** on the trace label to compute average and RMS over the visible window. RMS only reported for V or A units.

### FFT (Fourier Transform)

**View > FFT** to compute frequency spectrum.

- Proprietary algorithm: works with arbitrary number of datapoints (not limited to power of 2)
- Noise floor exceeds 300dB
- Enter desired number of bins directly

**For best FFT results:**
```spice
.options plotwinsize=0   ; disable compression
.tran 0 10m 0 1u        ; specify max timestep
.options numdgt=15       ; double precision
```

---

## User-Defined Functions

Custom functions and parameters for the waveform viewer.

**Menu**: Plot Settings > Edit Plot Defs File

**File location**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LTspice\plot.defs`

**Syntax** (same as SPICE `.param` and `.func`):
```
.func Pythag(x,y) {sqrt(x*x+y*y)}
.func dBV(x) {20*log10(abs(x))}
.param twopi = 2*pi
```

---

## Axis Control

- Move cursor beyond the data area until it changes to a ruler icon
- **Left-click** on the ruler to open axis configuration dialog

### Horizontal Axis (Real Data)

- Manually set range and scale type
- Enables parametric plots (plot one trace vs another)

### Vertical Axis (Complex/AC Data)

- Left-click left vertical axis to switch between:
  - Bode plot
  - Nyquist plot
  - Cartesian plot
- Right vertical axis options: phase, group delay, or none

---

## Plot Panes

Multiple plot panes can be displayed in one window for better trace organization.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Right-click plot area | Add pane above/below, move panes |
| Drag trace label to another pane | Move trace |
| Ctrl+release in another pane | Copy trace to that pane |

Each pane has independent autoscaling.

---

## Cursors

### Attaching Cursors

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Left-click trace label | Attach single cursor |
| Right-click label > "1st & 2nd" | Attach both cursors to one trace |
| Right-click label > Attached Cursor | Choose 1st, 2nd, or both |

### Moving Cursors

- Drag with mouse
- Arrow keys for fine positioning
- Up/Down keys navigate between .step/.dc/.temp runs

### Readout

- Cursor position shown in readout window
- Difference between cursors reported
- Right-click cursor to see step information for that run

### Status Bar Readout (No Cursor Needed)

- Mouse position always displayed on status bar
- Drag-zoom box size shown (quick measurement)
- Time differences converted to frequency

---

## Executing .MEAS Scripts

`.MEAS` statements are evaluated in post processing on the saved waveform dataset, so
they can be run against data already on disk — **no re-simulation required**.

**Menu**: With the waveform window active, **File > Execute .MEAS Script**

This runs a script of `.MEAS` statements against the displayed dataset and writes the
results to the log (**View > SPICE Output Log**, Ctrl+L). Use it to add or revise
measurements after a long run, or to iterate on measurement expressions against a fixed
dataset.

**Script file**: can be a plain netlist — LTspice reads only the `.MEAS` statements and
ignores every other line, so the circuit's own `.net` or `.cir` file works as-is.

**Accuracy**: results are limited by the accuracy of the waveform data *after*
compression. Disable compression for precise measurements:

```spice
.options plotwinsize=0   ; disable compression
```

*See [MEAS-REFERENCE.md](MEAS-REFERENCE.md) for `.MEAS` syntax and examples.*

## Color Control

**Menu**: Tools > Color Preferences

- Click objects in sample plot to select them
- Adjust colors with RGB sliders

---

## Plot Configurations

### File Format

- Extension: `.plt` (text files)
- Default name: same as `.raw` file with `.plt` extension
- Automatically loaded when data file opens (if file exists)

### Per-Analysis Settings

Each analysis type (.tran, .ac, .noise, etc.) has its own section. Cannot load settings from one analysis type to another, but can load `.plt` from a different simulation of the same analysis type.

### Menu Commands

- **Plot Settings > Save Plot Settings**
- **Plot Settings > Open Plot Settings**

---

## Fast Access File Format

Optimizes random-access performance for large waveform files.

### When to Use

- After simulation completes
- For files with many traces where you only view a few at a time
- Example: 5GB file with 2000 traces — load time drops from 4 minutes to ~1 second

### How to Convert

- **GUI**: Make waveform window active > Files > Convert to Fast Access
- **Command line**: `ltspice.exe -FastAccess <file>`

### Characteristics

- File size increase: only 11 bytes larger
- Speed improvement: factor roughly equal to number of saved traces
- Requires disk space equal to file size during conversion
- Can use up to 1/4 of physical RAM
- Conversion time may exceed original simulation time

### Limitations

- Real data only (not complex data from .AC analysis)
- Cannot append new data after conversion
- Standard format required during simulation

---

## Exporting Data

### Image Export

| Method | Format | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Clipboard bitmap | BMP | Right-click > Copy Image to Clipboard |
| Metafile (vector) | EMF | Tools > Write image to .emf file |

For metafile: use Arial font (Tools > Settings > Waveform > Font) — system fonts don't scale.

### Numerical Data Export

**Built-in**: Waveform menu > **File > Export** (ASCII file)

### Getting Equally-Spaced Timesteps

LTspice uses variable timesteps. To get uniform spacing:
1. Perform FFT on desired trace
2. Perform FFT on the FFT result (recovers equally-spaced time data)
3. Export that result

This is bit-accurate to double precision.

### Third-Party Tools

Helmut Sennewald's free utility (http://groups.io/g/LTspice) supports data manipulation including merging waveforms from different simulation runs.
